    "Note that this score may reflect bigrams that have words that have a high collocation but are used infrequently. For example, 'hot dog' might only appear twice in a text but the collocation score will be high because the word 'hot' only ever appears with the word 'dog'. While the two words are higly associative they may not be particularly relevant to a text's meaning. In order to take this into account we can also factor in the frequencyof the bigram in the text."

For example, we could identify verbs and nouns in a text by tagging them with a string that indicates this semantic meaning. Identifying the proper parts of speech is complicated in a text, particularly if there are many unknown, or new uses of words, or the text is highly idiosyncratic (like Twitter messages). However, NLTK does include a recommender speech tagger. \n",
