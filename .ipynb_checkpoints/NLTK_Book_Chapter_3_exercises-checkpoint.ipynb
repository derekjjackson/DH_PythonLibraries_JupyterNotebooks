The reality that I had known no longer\\r\\nexisted. It sufficed that Mme. Swann did not appear, in the same attire\\r\\nand at the same moment, for the whole avenue to be altered. The places\\r\\nthat we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which\\r\\nwe map them for our own convenience. None of them was ever more than a\\r\\nthin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our\\r\\nlife at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a\\r\\nparticular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as\\r\\nthe years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Swann\\'s Way, by Marcel Proust\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SWANN\\'S WAY ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 7178-8.txt or 7178-8.zip ***** This and\\r\\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/1/7/7178/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Eric Eldred, and David Widger\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\\r\\nrenamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\\r\\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\\r\\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\\r\\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\\r\\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\\r\\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\\r\\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\\r\\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\\r\\nFoundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state\\r\\nof Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue\\r\\nService. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification number\\r\\nis 64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations. Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887,\\r\\nemail business@pglaf.org. Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official page\\r\\nat http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\\r\\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\\r\\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\\r\\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\\r\\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\\r\\nthe IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\\r\\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\\r\\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\\r\\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\\r\\nplease visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\\r\\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\\r\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\\r\\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\\r\\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

have failed to outwit and outdo Marcel Duchamp (the French conceptual artist who placed a urinal in a gallery in 1917), I hadn\\'t realised that there was an artwork hanging on the walls of a London auction house which was about to do just that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nPA\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Banksy\\'s Girl With Balloon, 2006, estimated at £200,000 - £300,000\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat \"moment\" at Sotheby\\'s the other day when Banksy\\'s Girl with Balloon sold for £860,000 (just over £1m with add-ons) and promptly self-destructed in front of a gobsmacked auction room was a match for any of Duchamp\\'s mischievously ironic artworks.\\n\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Media captionThe anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post\\nBefore our very eyes, the familiar Banksy image of the girl with a balloon, for which an unnamed lady paid an unfathomably large sum, was transformed into an entirely new piece, retrospectively titled by the artist, Love is in the Bin.\"At first I was shocked,\" said the winning bidder and proud owner having decided to keep the work, \"but I realised I would end up with my own piece of art history.\" \\n\\n\\n            /**/\\n            (function() {\\n                if (window.bbcdotcom &&

\\n\\nAnd so she has. The idea of destroying one artwork to make another has turned into something of a genre post-Duchamp, who was the past master of the art stunt. In 1953, for example, Robert Rauschenberg famously rubbed out a drawing given to him by the revered Dutch artist Willem de Kooning. The American then spent two months obliterating the original image before mounting the now blank sheet of paper in a gilded frame, onto which his friend Jasper Johns inscribed with the words, Erased de Kooning Drawing. Robert Rauschenberg. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Erased de Kooning Drawing by Robert Rauschenberg, is a famous example of destroying one artwork to make another\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn light of which, and for the sake of clarity, the subject of this review is not a 2006 Banksy canvas in a mock Victorian frame, but the new artwork made by the artist via a remote control device live in the auction room on 5th October 2018. The one with shredded canvas hanging from the bottom of the frame, which is on display at Sotheby\\'s, London throughout the weekend. \\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nAFP/GETTY\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Love is in the Bin will come to be seen as one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century\\n                \\n\\nThis is what I think about Love is in the Bin. It will come to be seen as one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century. It is not a great painting that can be compared to a late Rembrandt, or a sculpture to sit alongside Michelangelo\\'s David, but in terms of conceptual art emanating from Duchamp\\'s Dadaist sensibility, it is exceptional. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Love is in the Bin isn\\'t a sculpture that sits alongside Michelangelo\\'s David\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was brilliant in both conception and execution. Take its initial creation, which was a stunning piece of site-specific, mechanically-aided, performance art; an attention-grabbing spectacle taking place within an attention-grabbing spectacle, which highlighted through dark satire how art has become an investment commodity to be auctioned off to ultra-wealthy trophy-hunters.  As an action, it was reminiscent of the K Foundation\\'s spectacle of burning a million pounds on the Isle of Jura in 1994. The difference here was the one million pound object Banksy destroyed could quite possibly be worth more, which, when you think about it, tells you all you need to know about a cynical art world and its values.Imagine you\\'d saved up all your money to buy a painting you truly loved and then at the very moment you were about to take it home someone came along and shredded it. Would you want your money back? Would you be angry? Sure you would, you loved that piece. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nSotheby\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut contemporary art is not valued for its inherent aesthetic qualities (although that is how it is presented to us), it is valued pretty much solely on the basis of an artist\\'s reputation. All that matters is the brand, that it is a Banksy, or a Koons, or a Kusama. For a lot of collectors art has become an asset class.Hence the talk after the event wasn\\'t about art but the asset. Will the shredded work be worth more, or less? Surreptitious calls were made suggesting potential buyers were already lining up to purchase it, should it come back on the market. Speculation mounted.Maybe the whole thing was an elaborate prank by Banksy. He could have put the piece up for auction through an associate and then bought it for the staggering sum of £1m knowing full well the sale wouldn\\'t go through because the work was about to be destroyed. You wouldn\\'t put that past him, would you?\\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nPA\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Banksy making a shredder to fit in a frame for Girl With Balloon\\n                \\n\\nAnd what about the shredder? How did that work? Were Sotheby\\'s in on it? If not, just how bad is its security not to spot an inbuilt metal contraption with (I assume) a remote control device installed? \\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nPA\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Why didn\\'t Sotheby\\'s security detect a metal contraption in the artwork?\\n                \\n\\nDuchamp would have loved it all. The provocation, the mystery (he signed his urinal R Mutt to hide his identity), the creation through destruction (he drew a goatee onto a postcard of the Mona Lisa to create an original artwork), the challenging question about the nature of art. What is Love is in the Bin? Is it a painting? Or, is it now a piece of conceptual art? Or should it be classified as a sculpture? Or is it rubbish?  Who decides? Who knows? Duchamp would say it is up to you to decide. My view? It is art. Made by an artist who many don\\'t rate but I do. Why? Because he has something to say. You might not agree with him, but at least he is making art that penetrates the public consciousness; art that is in the world, not detached from it; art that raises questions that need an airing.Banksy makes art that, as Hamlet said, holds \"…the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.\" And what artwork better captures the spirit of our times than Love is in the Bin? I can\\'t think of one.

       "'According to ReelSEO.com , a website about video marketing, there are more than two million cat videos on YouTube. People have watched these videos more than 25 billion times, which equates to an average of 12,000 views per cat video .\\nThe statistics speak for themselves, but they don\\'t tell the whole story.\\nPerhaps it\\'s because I\\'m a dog lover with a cat allergy, but the staggering amount of cat media available to internet users came as a surprise to me. With numbers like that, I couldn\\'t help but wonder: who, exactly, is so drawn to this type of content? And what effects do cat-related media have on viewers?\\nThe keyboard cat video has been viewed over 40 million times on YouTube.\\nThese were the overarching question that spurred my initial quest to gather empirical data on the internet cat phenomenon. I scoured academic databases to see what the literature could tell me, but found no existing data about why people watched so many cat videos online, or what effects these videos might have on us.\\nSo I decided to find out myself.\\nMy neighborhood internet celebrity feline – the adorable Lil Bub , who happens to also live in Bloomington, Indiana – shared the link on her website after I launched an online survey. With Bub\\'s help, the survey quickly garnered nearly 7,000 respondents.\\nThe results from this exploratory study suggest that certain people are, in fact, more likely than others to view copious amounts of internet cat videos. It also showed that cat videos can positively influence the emotions of viewers.\\nAccording to my study, if you currently own or have previously owned a cat – or if you\\'ve volunteered to assist pets in the past year – you\\'re more likely to watch cat videos. Cat video viewers also spent more time online than other participants, tended to be more agreeable and shy, and felt they had adequate emotional support in their lives. However, emotional stability was negatively (albeit only slightly) related to watching online cat-related media.\\nThe data also revealed information about the nature of audience interactions with online cat media. Three-quarters of respondents did not actively seek out cat content. Instead, they happened upon it in the course of their daily internet use.\\nThis means that it\\'s hard to avoid internet cats, even if you want to.\\nIt\\'s tough to avoid encountering internet cat celebrities like Lil Bub.\\nStill, online cat videos aren\\'t all about passive consumption.

       "'According to ReelSEO.com , a website about video marketing, there are more than two million cat videos on YouTube. People have watched these videos more than 25 billion times, which equates to an average of 12,000 views per cat video .The statistics speak for themselves, but they don\\'t tell the whole story.Perhaps it\\'s because I\\'m a dog lover with a cat allergy, but the staggering amount of cat media available to internet users came as a surprise to me. With numbers like that, I couldn\\'t help but wonder: who, exactly, is so drawn to this type of content? And what effects do cat-related media have on viewers?The keyboard cat video has been viewed over 40 million times on YouTube.These were the overarching question that spurred my initial quest to gather empirical data on the internet cat phenomenon. I scoured academic databases to see what the literature could tell me, but found no existing data about why people watched so many cat videos online, or what effects these videos might have on us.So I decided to find out myself.My neighborhood internet celebrity feline – the adorable Lil Bub , who happens to also live in Bloomington, Indiana – shared the link on her website after I launched an online survey. With Bub\\'s help, the survey quickly garnered nearly 7,000 respondents.The results from this exploratory study suggest that certain people are, in fact, more likely than others to view copious amounts of internet cat videos. It also showed that cat videos can positively influence the emotions of viewers.According to my study, if you currently own or have previously owned a cat – or if you\\'ve volunteered to assist pets in the past year – you\\'re more likely to watch cat videos. Cat video viewers also spent more time online than other participants, tended to be more agreeable and shy, and felt they had adequate emotional support in their lives. However, emotional stability was negatively (albeit only slightly) related to watching online cat-related media.The data also revealed information about the nature of audience interactions with online cat media. Three-quarters of respondents did not actively seek out cat content. Instead, they happened upon it in the course of their daily internet use.This means that it\\'s hard to avoid internet cats, even if you want to.It\\'s tough to avoid encountering internet cat celebrities like Lil Bub.Still, online cat videos aren\\'t all about passive consumption. Many people indicated they also produce their own cat-related media to post online, which often amass comments and likes. Online cat-media consumption is therefore an interactive process where media consumers can be media producers and media critics, all in the same space.But I really wanted to learn what effects watching online cat videos might have on viewers.People in my study reported experiencing more positive emotions and having higher energy levels after watching cat videos than before. They also reported lower levels of negative emotions after viewing online cat-related content.In short, most of us get a little psychological \"pick-me-up\" when we watch Lil Bub climb the stairs or view a hilarious Grumpy Cat meme.You might wonder: So what? Why does this study matter beyond its momentary entertainment value?Well, we now spend more time with media than ever before. If – as my study suggests – part of that media diet includes cute pet videos, then it\\'s important to know how that specific genre impacts us psychologically if we want to truly understand the role of media use in shaping who we are.Second, media is often criticized (sometimes rightfully so) for harming society – for making us violent , confused about science or even narcissistic .
