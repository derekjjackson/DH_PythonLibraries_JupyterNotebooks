    "Machine leanring is just an algoritm that a computer uses to make generalizations about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)<br/>\n",
    "This is and open source package built on several libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Machine Learning Process\n",
    "1. Define the problem and indetify the research question.\n",
    "2. Find the Data\n",
    "3. Prepare the data (munging)\n",
    "4. Select the algorithm\n",
    "5. Train the model\n",
    "6. Test the model\n",
    "7. Communicate/share results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning algorithms:\n",
    "* Classification: assign some data to a class. Is email spam.\n",
    "* Regression: predict a value based on a set of features: based on location an dsize what is the price of a house.\n",
    "* Clustering: looking for patterns in data. Categorizing text\n",
    "* Rule Extraction: Recommendation engines. Given a set of data and some rules we can make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of machine learning with classification\n",
    "Is a flower a daisy or a rose. \n",
    "The corpus is the set of data we have that gives us the information the algorithm will use to learn how to distinguish the characteristics of daisies and roses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to choose and Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the algorithm is chosen we train it on a set of training data from the corpus. E.g. white pedals = daisy, red = rose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input vectors are the color of the pedal. The output we desire is what type of flower we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised and Unsupervised learning\n",
    "### supervised\n",
    "These algorithms that have lables associated with the training data that are used to correct and tune the model. For example, we have location and size data for a house and we want to predict the price. We know the labels (price and size) and we want to learn how the predict cost. Using the data corpus we can adjust the model so that it can predict a target variable (e.g. price). \n",
    "\n",
    "This data set has a set of feature vectors or variables, the x variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attribute that we want to predict is called the label, or the y variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### unsupervised\n",
    "The model is set up to learn the patterns and structures in the data when we do not know what the correlations might be. Given a large set of data these algorithms look for relationships that are not apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have no labels, we do not know what our y variable is, and we only have the x variables. From this data unsupervised algorithms look for patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a common type of unsupervised machine learning, which is a methof of identifying groups of similar content after an analysis of a selected group of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data types\n",
    "### Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "This is data that has an infinite set of values in a range. These are values like salary, height, weight, age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Data\n",
    "This is data that has a limited number of values. These are values like Month, color, day of the week, yes/no.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data canot necessarily be ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling Data\n",
    "This is also called normalization. The purpose is to standardized the variability in feature details. The exam data below has student scores and it is not clear if they are scores out of 100, out of 120, etc. To work with this data we need to standardize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "First know that a vector is simply a list of numbers (1,2,5,3). To visualize what this means for machine learning it helps to think of a 2-dimensional vector that can be plotted on a cartesian plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/vector2D.png\" style=\"margin-top:2em;width:40%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can contain a number of numbers, but it is difficult for us to visualize such a complicated system of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning each measurement we have is a feature. You can think of this as the columns in a table. If we are trying to determing the cost of a house, some features we might consider are the number of bedrooms, the square footage, the number of bathrooms, etc. These data points are our features and a collection of these data points for one house would be the feature vector for that house. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to identify features that can correlate to the target variable you want to predict. To continue the house example, including the weight of the home owner would probably not be a useful feature for determining the proce of a house, while looking at the size of the house in square feet might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where domain knowledge is very valuable for identifying useful features. A environmental scientist could be better suited for identifying useful features when trying to predict climate change than a software developer. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, another way to look at feature determination is to look at it from a mathematical point of view and see what features correlate mathematically to the target variable best. This is often a useful approach and one that different algorithms rely on as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these two approaches is often the most effective. "

    "## Using numeric data to analyze text\n",
    "So what does this mean for text data?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we use numeric data to analyze text. Let's think about this in the context of a sentiment analyzer for a review. Imagine our review of the movie is: \"This was the best movie!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine our `text = 'This was the best movie!'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Well we can tokenize it to `tokens = ['This', 'was', 'the', 'best', 'movie']`\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use one hot method on the set of vocabulary so that if a sentence has certain words we can esatblish a correlation. For example, the `tokens` document would become something like `[('This',1),('was',1), ('the',1), ('best',1), ('movie',1)].`\n",
    "\n",
    "Probelms with this is that it does not count frequency if we reduce its vocabulary to generate the one hot integers. It also doe not take into account order. And as the corpus grows its vocabulary the matrix becomes enormous, more like a sparse matrix. This is not a very intelligent way to represent the sentence information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better method is Frequence based embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency based embeddings\n",
    "These rely on count (how many times a word has occured in a document) and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)\n",
    "#### Count\n",
    "If we see that the word 'bad' occurs more frequently in a review then we can say the movie is reviewed negatively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problems arise here agian:\n",
    "* If the corpus is very large then again we have a huge set of feature vectors (the vocabulary). \n",
    "* We are still losing the context of the words.\n",
    "* Semantics and relationships are not preserved\n",
    "\n",
    "Some solutions to deal with a large vocabulary could be to limit the number of words we choose. We could rely on the top 50 words in our word count but we have seen before that this favors words that might not convey any useful information (e.g. \"a\", \"the\", \"an\"). To remedy this we may filter out stopwords that do not affect the sentiment of a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is to hash words to buckets to reduce the vocabulary size. This means if we have 10,000 words we can create 8,000 buckets. We need to be careful to not create buckets that minimize the amount of collisions, that is we don't have two words that map to the same bucket. For example we could put the words \"actor\" and \"actress\" into one bucket if we are trying to evalute if a review is describing good or bad acting. THese two words are now treated as one and counted as one. So the the sentence \"the actor was great and the actress was unknown\" would get 2 counts for the \"actor, actress\" bucket. We would never know that these are separate words however in our count, only that this bucket has a higher count than other buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document frequency)\n",
    "This is a measure of how often a word occurs in a document compared to how often it occurs in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF looks at how often a term appears in a single document. So the more often a word appears in the document it is likely to be considered important. This is considered against how often a word appears in the corpus. So the logic is that a word that appears more frequently in a document but less frequently in the corpus is a significant term for that document. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has the advantage of reducing the feature vector size and giving relevance to frequency in a document. However we still have the draw back that the context of the word is not captured.\n",
